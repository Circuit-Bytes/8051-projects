## Features
- Real-time visitor counting
- Increments and decrements count based on sensor/switch
- Display on 2-digit 7-segment


## Files Included
- `visitor-counter.c` - Embedded C code
- `visitor-counter.dsn` - Proteus file

## Concepts Used
- Basic port and delay logic
- 7-segment multiplexing
- Conditional logic in C
